animal_cruelty_notes = {
    "Mink fur": "Minks are confined in small, wire cages without enrichment, often driven to self-mutilation and stress-induced behaviors. They are commonly killed by gassing or electrocution, experiencing fear and suffering solely for fashion.",
    "Fox fur": "Foxes are bred on fur farms, kept in cramped cages with wire flooring that injures their paws. Killing methods include gassing and electrocution, causing prolonged distress and pain.",
    "Rabbit fur": "Rabbits are kept in overcrowded hutches and handled roughly; many suffer broken bones and severe stress. They are slaughtered for trims and linings despite plentiful alternatives.",
    "Shearling (lamb)": "Shearling requires killing lambs for their skin and wool. Transport and slaughter can involve fear, rough handling, and painful procedures.",
    "Goose down": "Down is often obtained from birds who may be live-plucked or subjected to force-feeding in related industries. Handling causes pain and distress, and slaughter ends in a violent death.",
    "Duck down": "Ducks face similar suffering as geese, with live-plucking reported and stressful confinement. Their bodies are commodified for insulation despite humane options.",
    "Wool": "Intensive wool production can involve mulesing, rough shearing, and stressful transport. Injuries are common, with animals treated as raw materials.",
    "Calfskin leather": "Calves are separated from mothers early, transported long distances, and slaughtered for hides. The tanning process also carries environmental toxins.",
    "Lambskin leather": "Lambs, still young, are killed for their soft hides. Transport, handling, and slaughter create fear and pain for sensitive animals.",
    "Crocodile leather": "Crocodiles are raised in concrete pens with minimal enrichment. Methods include electrocution and cutting while conscious, causing severe suffering.",
    "Alligator leather": "Alligators on farms endure overcrowding and stress; killing can involve crude tools and inadequate stunning, leading to prolonged pain.",
    "Ostrich leather": "Ostriches are deprived of natural space and slaughtered for exotic skins; handling and killing are stressful and frightening.",
    "Python skin": "Snakes may be inflated with water or air and skinned, sometimes while still moving. Capture and transport are highly stressful for wild-caught individuals.",
    "Lizard skin": "Lizards are often tied and left for hours before slaughter; inhumane methods can leave them conscious during skinning.",
    "Silk": "Conventional silk production boils silkworms alive in their cocoons to preserve filament quality, killing thousands for a single item.",
    "Cashmere": "Goats are combed harshly in cold seasons, with injuries and stress common; expanding demand drives land degradation and animal suffering.",
    "Mohair": "Angora goats are handled roughly during shearing; investigations show ear cutting and injuries, with animals left bleeding and stressed.",
    "Leather": "Leather relies on slaughter and often long, stressful transport. Tanning contributes to pollution that harms workers and ecosystems.",
    "Suede (leather)": "Suede is produced from animal hides, meaning animals are slaughtered; the split leather process does not reduce the inherent cruelty.",
